lede: Survivor has become one of my favorite shows, here's my elevator pitch.

If you’ve spoken with me in the past year or so at one point or another I’ve probably waxed poetically about the CBS reality show Survivor. Typically I’m met with two reactions: “That show is still on?” and/or “I’m not really a fan of trashy reality shows, I’m pretty sure they’re all rigged anyways”. It’s funny because I basically went through the same thought process when I was initially introduced to the show by my roommate. Trust me when I say that I wholeheartedly believe that Survivor is one of the most fun and entertaining shows to dive down the rabbit hole on. The best seasons strike the balance of great character story arcs and engaging social strategy that becomes a ton of fun to participate in as a viewer (Who’s going home? Who’s going to win? Will X save Y by using a game advantage? etc.).

What follows is the best condensement that I can put together about the show in it's current state that forms my elevator pitch.

Note: I’m going to assume you’re familiar with the basic concept of the show.

## That show is still on?

Yup! As of time of writing we’re about to head into season 40. What keeps the show fresh, interesting, engaging, and frankly still on the air is what is, in my opinion, the killer hook for the show. Pretty much the only people that go on Survivor anymore are mega nerds who know everything, so in recent years they have evolved the social game to something that’s nearly unrecognizable to past seasons. They are free to experiment and try new moves and strategies because everyone knows all the old moves and how to counter them. The modern era of Survivor (starting from 28 onwards) is incredibly exciting to follow because of those long watching nerds and I fully believe that the show would have been cancelled if not for this evolution of strategy.

Another consequence of the long running nature of the show is that returnee seasons have become fairly common, and are incredibly entertaining to watch. As the game evolves and old players return they have to step up their old gameplay or even try new strategies to get as far as possible. It’s hard not to have favorites on a particular season, and then get excited when they come back in for another run at the game.

## Isn’t it just trashy and rigged?

Ok so the show isn’t about survival anymore. Let’s just get that out of the way. Production gives them food, clean water, and all the tools they need pretty much out of the gate. In the modern seasons the only real threat is just rain. And yes, it is more sanitary to be in as minimal clothing as possible and clean yourself off vs wearing tons of dirty clothes.

As for rigging / staged events this is fascinating because some of the best seasons have moments and moves that are so unbelievable and crazy it’s hard to imagine how the players could have pulled them off. The thing is, I can assure you that production could not feasibly orchestrate any sort of narrative while filming is taking place. There’s just way too many variables at play with the number of people and their spider web of social relationships not to mention the physical challenges which decide who gets to stay another day would be silly to try and orchestrate a “winner”.

What is fun to watch is the editing that production does based on the footage that they have and see how they tell the stories of different characters and their evolution over time, their rise and fall, etc. since they know who ends up winning. In fact, a number of Survivor seasons have reflected and commented on major social issues and it should be commended that production allows players to dynamically interface with these issues compared to other reality shows (*cough Big brother, Bachelorverse, etc *cough) that gloss over these situations.

## Ok but there’s too many seasons

I would recommend just watching an episode and going from there. No commitment, but I think most of the premiers do a good job at hitting on all the things I love about the show and if you didn’t find it fun or don’t have a nagging curiosity to see who ends up winning the season that’s totally fine.

CBS All Access is ideal here and the free trial might be worth it to you. You can watch most of the seasons on Hulu, and a random grab bag on Amazon Prime. I would watch the season 33 (Millennials v Gen x — don’t take this theme too seriously) premier. That season has some iconic characters and moments, while having a good ramp up for the strategy through the season.
